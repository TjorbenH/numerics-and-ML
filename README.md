# Collection of Projects/Experiments on Numerics and Machine-Learning

## Experiments 
These are the actual small experimental projects. The main goal here is to flesh out my theoretical knowledge and explore some interesting concepts and algorithms. The common theme here is that none of this is "exact science", instead these experiments focus on using computing to tackle soft or non-analytical problems.

### Completed
Hopefully there will be an actual list here in the near future.

### Works in Progress
Things I'm currently working on and implementing.
