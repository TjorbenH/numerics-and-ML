    "## The Problem\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "We are looking at a double pendulum with two limbs that are massless and of length $l_1$ and $l_2$. Attached at the bottom of those limbs are two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We will only consider pendulums that move in the 2D plane. \n",

    "#### Position of the Pendulums \n",
    "The position of the two masses will be described according to the angle of the limbs to the vertical. We can denote the positions of the masses according to those two angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$. \n",
