## Problem Abstract
In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum, also known as a chaotic pendulum, is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, forming a complex physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic. 

## Project
The main goal is to explore different numerical methods for solving the ODEs underlying the motion of the double pendulum. These will be compared along various metrics such as speed of convergence, necessary compute, local and global error.
